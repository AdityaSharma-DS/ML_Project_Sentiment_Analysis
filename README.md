<h1>Sentiment Analysis </h1>

<h2>Data Description:</h2>

    A sentiment analysis job about the problems of each major U.S. airline.
    Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").


<h2>Summary:</h2>

    We used dataset which has tweets in text format and their sentiment type (positive, negative and neutral).
    The goal was to build a model for text-classification.
    We Pre-processed the data using variuos techniques and libraries.
    The pre-precessed data is converted to numbers, so that we can feed the data in the model.
    After building the classification model, we predicted the result for the test data.
    After that we saw that using the above techniques, our model performed good in perspective of how the text classification models perform.
    One more way to increase accuracy is to use different variations of Pre-processing techniques.
